# Cervical Cancer detection using XG-Boost Algorithm

## Summary
Cervical cancer, which develops in the cells of the cervix, causes over 300,000 deaths in women worldwide each year. Using machine learning (XGBoost) and patient data, this project aims to enable early detection, helping reduce mortality through timely intervention.
